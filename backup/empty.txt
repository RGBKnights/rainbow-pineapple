Hello @{OWNER} and thanks for invite 🌈🍍!

However 🌈🍍 is not able to Initialize a repository at this time. 

FEAR NOT!

Thre are the instructuions on how to fix this problem:
1. Navigate to {URL}. This will redirect you to the github file editor to create ReadMe. Review and change if you wish.
2. When done with edits and/or review click the green "Commmit new file".
3. Afterwhich github will redirect you to the main branch and the repository is initialized.

When the issuse is reloved remove and invite the bot to this repository again.
